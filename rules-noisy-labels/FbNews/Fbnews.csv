Ellensburg Animal Shelter was informed that domestic rabbits had been set loose in Ellensburg and Frank is one of the offsprings that was brought to the shelter. He requires more supervision then a cat or dog because rabbits will test nibble on dangerous material such as electrical wires. The shelter recommends researching domestic rabbit ownership really well at House Rabbit Society or https://rabbit.org/. Rabbits may do well with other pets but this is strictly based on circumstances. Rabbits make good apartment pets but require lots of maintenance and supervision. The shelter said that Frank has been using the litter box inside his kennel. The shelter recommends Frank to be an indoor pet with outdoor privileges and supervision. Frank hasn't learned her name yet, and is open to a name change. Frank will be spayed before adoption. If Frank is no longer available at the shelter, there will still be other pets in need of a good home. To adopt a pet contact the shelter at (509) 962-7246 or visit 1007 Industrial Way, Ellensburg. ARRF Animal Rescue in Roslyn also offers a way for potential pet owners to adopt. Fees may vary."
