# Rules and Generated Noisy Labels

**Labeling Functions** and **Labeling Results** of the rule-based classifier in **Learning from Multi-SourceWeak Supervision for Deep Text Classification**

## Labeling Functions
Labeling functions of each dataset are demonstrated in the corresponding folder. They generate labels from different perspectives.

- AGnews: 8 heuristic rules on **keywords**
- IMDB: 4 heuristic rules on **keywords** and 4 heuristic rules on **expressions**
- Spouse: same as [Snorkel-spouse][1]
- Yelp: 7 heuristic rules on **keywords** and 1 thirdparty model (TextBlob) on **polarity of sentiment**
- Youtube: same as [Snorkel-spam][2]

## Labeling Results
For each data point, the raw text, noisy labels generated by each labeling function and the majority label are demonstrated in the corresponding folder.
